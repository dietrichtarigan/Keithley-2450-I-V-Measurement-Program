# Keithley-2450-I-V-Measurement-Program
A modular, fully configurable GUI application for I-V curve measurements using the Keithley 2450 Source Measure Unit (SMU) via GPIB interface. This application allows users to perform voltage sweeps, measure currents, calculate resistances, and visualize I-V curves in real-time.
